The challenge for the data incubator
I look at the data from the World Bank, especially in relation to gender and poverty.

<b>Inspiration: </b>Hans Rosling (whom I saw at CGI U 2015) and the research I have done with YN on female founders (attached is the presentation I gave at the SF Data Mining Meetup) <br>
<b> What do I want to do:</b> Look at the data on females, in particular in the following areas: education, health, economy and employment, if possible (time-wise) power and decision-making<br><br>

 I want to explore how different factors relate to each other – for example, what impact do children in employment have on the health?  I want to explore if based on factors such as literacy rate and access to electricity one can predict the life expectancy, if (and if so, by how much) a doctor being present at birth of a child makes a significant difference to the health of both mother and children and what impact that will have on their future.<br>
I want to also explore if there are any interesting trends in what happened in the past – have there been any unexpected changes firms with female top managers? Have there been any trends or changes in employment and agriculture and services
And finally, if there was one or two things we could change to improve lives of females, what would that be? What actions can we take to make women’s lives better?<br><br>
<b>Who it could be of interest to:</b> Policy makers, gender equality advocates<br>
<b>Data sources:</b> World Bank, Gapminder Foundation, International Labour Organisation, World Health Organisation<br>
<b>What analysis do I want to do:</b> TimeSeries, Correlation, Clustering (right now, there are two ways to cluster: by geography and income), Regression<br><br>
<b>STUDY 1: EDUCATION</b><br>
I took two approaches: looking by income levels (high, middle, low) and by geographical areas (World and 13 geographical areas: East Asia & Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America & Caribbean, Middle East & North Africa, South Asia, Sub Saharan Africa, Arab World, Caribbean small states, Central Europe and the Baltics, Euro area, European Union, Fragile and conflict affected geographies, Pacific island small states)<br>
I looked at the following factors:<br>
Number of children out of school, primary completion rate, survival rate to the last grade of primary school, youth literacy age, effective transition from primary to secondary.<br>
FINDINGS: <br>
<b>Primary school:</b> There does not seem to be a lot of difference for high-income countries. Sadly, there
is a discrepancy for boys and girls in mid-income countries, which is even bigger for countries
with low-income. It also looks like for poorer countries, there are a lot more kids in primary
school than there are expected at this age - that may indicate that there are a lot of repeaters. I am not sure about that because I don’t have data on the number of repeaters (the World Bank does not have sufficient coverage for this topic). Another theory is that those low-income countries could be related to conflicted areas which could lead to repeaters etc. <br>
<b>Out of school children:</b> In high income countries, there seem to be more male children out of school, in middle income more girls out of school and even more girls for low-income countries.<br>
<b>Primary completion rate:</b> Highest in high-income countries (marginally higher for girls), lower for girls in middle countries, lowest for lowest income countries (and still lower for girls than for boys).<br>
<b>Survival rate to the last grade of primary school:</b> For high-income countries, higher for girls than boys but by a very small difference, this difference becomes bigger for mid-income countries (more girls than boys) and even bigger for low-income countries.<br>
<b>Youth literacy age:</b> For high-income countries, it has been increasing and is almost 100% for both genders, middle-income countries it is higher for boys than for girls and it is still highest for boys in low-income countries.<br>
<b>Effective transition from primary to secondary:</b> Slight increase for high-income countries but overall, quite steady and equal for both genders, marginally smaller for boys than girls in middle-income countries, marginally bigger for boys than girls in low-income countries.<br><br>
<b>STUDY 2: AGE ON FIRST MARRIAGE</b> <br>
Age on first marriage for females (2005, source: Gapminder Foundation) and comparison with a few metrics (also from 2005):<br>
<b>Fertility rate: </b> From the graph, there seems to be some sort of negative correlation - so the younger you get married at, the more children you are likely to have. <br>
<b>Child mortality rate:</b> That seems to be egatively correlated - so the younger you get married at, the more likely the child is to die<br>
<b>Prevalence of contraceptives:</b> People who get married at older age usually live in places where contraceptives are more prevalent.<br>
<b>Primary completion rate:</b> If you completed primary school, you seem to be a bit less likely to marry young (that seemed to be a trend both for females and males).
